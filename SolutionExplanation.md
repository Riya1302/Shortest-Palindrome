### Problem Breakdown:
We are tasked with finding the shortest palindrome by adding characters at the beginning of the string `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward and forward. The challenge is to do this efficiently.

### Approach:
1. **Reverse the string**: To transform the string into a palindrome, the most intuitive way is to compare the string with its reverse. If the string starts as a palindrome, you don’t need to add much; if it doesn’t, you want to identify the longest palindromic prefix in the string and then add the smallest number of characters in front to form a palindrome.

2. **Use the KMP Algorithm**: We can apply the **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) pattern matching algorithm**. KMP uses an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array, which allows us to find the longest palindromic prefix efficiently by matching the original string with its reverse.

---

### Code Explanation:

#### 1. Reverse the string
```javascript
const rev = s.split('').reverse().join('');
```
- Here, we reverse the original string `s` to get `rev`. This reversed string will help us figure out what characters need to be added to make `s` a palindrome.

#### 2. Combine original and reversed strings
```javascript
const combined = s + '#' + rev;
```
- We concatenate the original string `s`, a separator (`#`), and the reversed string `rev`. The separator `#` is used to prevent any overlap between the original string and its reverse. The goal is to compare `s` with `rev` to find the longest palindromic prefix in `s`. By using the separator, we ensure that `s` and `rev` don’t accidentally match unless it’s part of the palindrome.

#### 3. Compute the LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array
```javascript
const lps = buildLPS(combined);
```
- We call the `buildLPS` function to compute the **LPS array** for the combined string. The LPS array tells us the length of the longest prefix of the string `combined` that is also a suffix. The key insight is that this value gives us the length of the longest palindromic prefix of `s`.

---

### Detailed Explanation of the `buildLPS` function:

The KMP algorithm computes the LPS array, which helps us find the longest palindromic prefix efficiently.

#### 1. Initialize LPS array
```javascript
const lps = new Array(s.length).fill(0);
```
- We initialize an array `lps` of the same length as the combined string, filled with zeros. Each position `i` in the `lps` array will eventually store the length of the longest proper prefix of the substring `s[0:i+1]` that is also a suffix.

#### 2. Variables to track the current prefix length and iterator
```javascript
let length = 0;
let i = 1;
```
- `length`: Tracks the length of the current prefix that is also a suffix.
- `i`: Iterator variable that starts at `1` because the LPS value for the first character is always `0`.

#### 3. Build the LPS array
```javascript
while (i < s.length) {
    if (s[i] === s[length]) {
        length++;
        lps[i] = length;
        i++;
    } else {
        if (length !== 0) {
            length = lps[length - 1];
        } else {
            lps[i] = 0;
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```
- This is the core of the KMP algorithm.
  - If `s[i] === s[length]`, then the current character matches the prefix, and we increment both `length` and `i`. We update `lps[i]` to store the current `length` of the longest prefix that is also a suffix.
  - If the characters do not match, we check the `length`. If `length !== 0`, we backtrack using the previous longest prefix stored in `lps[length - 1]`. This reduces unnecessary comparisons.
  - If `length === 0`, then no proper prefix matches the suffix at this point, and we move to the next character (`i++`).

---

### Final Steps in `shortestPalindrome`:

#### 4. Determine characters to add in front
```javascript
const toAdd = rev.slice(0, s.length - lps[lps.length - 1]);
```
- `lps[lps.length - 1]` gives us the length of the longest palindromic prefix in the original string `s`.
- We take the characters from the reverse of `s` that are not part of the palindrome (i.e., from the start of the reversed string until `s.length - lps[lps.length - 1]`).
- These characters will be added in front of `s` to form the palindrome.

#### 5. Return the shortest palindrome
```javascript
return toAdd + s;
```
- Finally, concatenate the necessary characters from the reverse (`toAdd`) to the original string `s` and return the result.

---

### Test Cases:

```javascript
console.log(shortestPalindrome("aacecaaa")); // Output: "aaacecaaa"
console.log(shortestPalindrome("abcd"));     // Output: "dcbabcd"
```
- In the first case, the longest palindromic prefix is `"aacecaa"`. The character `"a"` from the reverse is added in front, giving `"aaacecaaa"`.
- In the second case, there is no palindromic prefix. Therefore, the entire reverse `"dcb"` is added in front of `"abcd"` to form `"dcbabcd"`.

---

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. 
  - Reversing the string takes `O(n)`.
  - Constructing the `combined` string also takes `O(n)`.
  - Building the LPS array is linear, `O(n)`, as each character in the combined string is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the extra space used for the `rev` and `lps` arrays.

This solution is highly efficient and works even for large inputs due to its linear time complexity.
